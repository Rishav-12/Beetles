# snakes
A Fun Project/Game

### Motivation
Working with pygame to make simple 2D games

### Requirements
* Python
* Pygame

### Description
* Built using Pygame
* I kept the last version of the game here in 'prev.py' because I actually liked it and its still playable

### How to play
* Start the game by double-clicking main.py file
* Use arrow keys to control the snake
* The snake dies if it hits the walls or its own tail
* You eat one food, you get 10 points
* Also speed increases as you collect points
* High Score implemented
* **Note**: If you quit midway, your high score will not get registered
